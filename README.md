## Description
* My motivation for this project was to showcase to myself that I have the HTML and CSS skills to build a website. I want to pursue a career in coding as soon as I can and the best way to do that is to just keep on coding. With websites like "Webflow", "Wix", and "GoDaddy" it may seem that web development isn't a lucrative skill however my belief is that if I have strong grip on the fundamentals of HTML and CSS that I can create a better website than on any of the aforementioned websites. 

* I built this project to take my recently acquired knowledge of HTML and CSS and put it to practice by building a portfolio website which I can add to as the course progresses. Eventually I will use it to show employers the web applications I've developed. My portfolio website can be the reason why I get a job! 

* My portfolio website is a super convenient place for employers or other people to connect with me to get a feel of what I'm about and view my best work. 

* After completing this assignment I've gained a deeper understanding of CSS flexbox, styling, positioning, hover effects, and I played around with MANY other CSS properties that are available to build a great website! There are so many I could spend another day implementing more CSS properties to make my website even better but I have to stop and turn this assignment in at some point.
